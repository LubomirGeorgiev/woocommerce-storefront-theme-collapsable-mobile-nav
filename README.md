# WooCommerce Storefront Theme Collapsable Mobile Nav

# Demo

![Demo gif](assets/demo.gif?raw=true "Title")

## Very short story of how this code and repository came about:
I was working on a [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) project where I used the [Storefront theme](Storefront%20theme).
At some point I decided test the website on mobile and I was startled by how ugly the mobile navigation looked when you have multiple levels of submenus so I decided to fix this mess.

At first I thought that I could override Storefront's navigation functionality with PHP but pretty soon I realized that I don't really want to do that at all :D and I also realized that with some JavaScript, jQuery and CSS magic this all can be fixed really easily.

## How to install
All of the files in this repository are meant to be installed as a child theme to [storefront](https://woocommerce.com/storefront/) so here are the steps below:

 1. Download the whole repository using [this](https://github.com/LubomirGeorgiev/woocommerce-storefront-theme-collapsable-mobile-nav/archive/master.zip) link or the green "Clone or download" button on the GitHub interface
 2. In your WordPress installation in `./wp-content/themes` create a new folder `storefront-child` and dump all the files that you downloaded there.
 3. Go to the admin panel of your WordPress and navigate to `Appearance -> Themes` and activate the child theme.
 4. Enjoy (If you give this repository a start that will also be appreciated) :D

# TODO

 1. Add a visual gif demo to the README.md file
